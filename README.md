# iMAAPs
To infer multiple-wave admixture by fitting ALD using a p-spectrum

iMAAPs is a powerful tool to estimate multiple-wave population admixed time, which is currently designed to infer the two-way, multiple-wave admixture based on admixture induced LD. This software can deal with genotype data, haplotype data and the data re-coded according to admixture ancestries.
